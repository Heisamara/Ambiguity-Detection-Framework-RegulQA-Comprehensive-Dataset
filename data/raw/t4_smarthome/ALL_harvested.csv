OpenHAB_Dev_Guide.html,"Java JDK 21, for example the Eclipse Temurin 21 JDK (opens new window) . On Windows: %JAVA% must be set."
W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,"The key words MAY , MUST , MUST NOT , SHOULD , and SHOULD NOT in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [ RFC2119 ] [ RFC8174 ] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here."
W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,"In this case, when two devices that have server roles are connected, at least one device must have also a client role that issues a message to the other to actuate or notify."
W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,"Some examples for Actions are setting multiple Properties simultaneously, changing Properties over time such as fading the brightness of a light (dimming) or with a process that shall not be disclosed such as a proprietary control loop algorithm, or invoking a long-lasting process such as printing a document."
W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,"Form contexts and submission targets MUST both be Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [ RFC3987 ]. However, in the common case, they will also be URIs [ RFC3986 ], because many protocols (such as HTTP) do not support IRIs."
W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,The request method MUST identify one method of the standard set of the protocol identified by the submission target URI scheme.
W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,"All data (a.k.a. content) exchanged when activating Interaction Affordances MUST be identified by a media type [ RFC2046 ] in the Protocol Binding. Media types are labels to identify representation formats, for instance application/json for JSON [ RFC8259 ] or application/cbor for CBOR [ RFC7049 ]. They are managed by IANA."
W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,"On the other hand, Consumers are always implemented by Servients , as they must be able to process the Thing Description (TD) format and must have a protocol stack that can be configured through Protocol Binding information contained in the TDs."
W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,"Any introduction mechanism used for WoT Discovery must not provide metadata but instead should simply result in one or more opaque URLs at which metadata may be accessed, if and only if the user can authenticate and has the appropriate authorization (access rights)."
W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,"Introduction URLs must not themselves include any metadata, e.g. a human-readable device type or name. Randomly generated URLs are recommended."
W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,Subprotocol Transport protocols may have to use information provided by an extension mechanisms to interact successfully. Such subprotocols cannot be identified from the URI scheme alone and must be declared explicitly using the subprotocol field inside forms. Examples for HTTP are long polling [ RFC6202 ] ( longpoll ) or Server-Sent Events [ HTML ] ( sse ).

W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,"Technically, the Thing abstraction and its Interaction Model is implemented in a runtime system. This WoT Runtime maintains the execution environment for the behavior implementation and is able to expose and/or consume Things , and hence must be able to fetch, process, serialize, and serve WoT Thing Descriptions ."
W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,"However, especially for new systems, the WoT architecture should enable the use of best practices. In general, the WoT security architecture must support the goals and mechanisms of the IoT protocols and systems it connects to. These systems vary in their security requirements and risk tolerance, so security mechanisms will also vary based on these factors."
W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,"In general, security cannot be guaranteed. It is not possible for the WoT to turn an insecure system into a secure one. However, the WoT architecture needs to do no harm: it should support security at least as well as the systems it describes and supports."
W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,"The metadata contained in a WoT Thing Description (TD) is potentially sensitive. As a best practice, TDs should be used together with appropriate integrity protection mechanisms and access control policies, with the goal of providing it only to authorized users."
W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,The WoT Runtime implementation and the WoT Scripting API should have mechanisms to prevent malicious access to the system and isolate scripts in multi-tenant Servients . More specifically the WoT Runtime implementation when used with the WoT Scripting API should consider the following security and privacy risks and implement the recommended mitigations.
W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,"In general, these risks and mitigations should also be applied to any system that supports programmable behavior for WoT systems, not just the WoT Scripting API ."
W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,"In order to reduce the damage to a physical WoT device in cases a script gets compromised, it is important to minimize the number of interfaces that are exposed or accessible to a particular script based on its functionality. The WoT Runtime SHOULD NOT directly expose low-level device hardware interfaces to the script developers."
W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,"In general, a Thing should always have at least one user interface (either direct or network-based) that is fully accessible according to WCAG and EN 301 549. Accessibility must be applied to the interfaces made available for all types of users: manufacturers, installers, device owners, end users."
W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,"Components that do not directly offer a user interface must still support accessibility by providing suitable data and functions. For example, developers of public Things (e.g. a ticket machine or an ATM) should consider a locator function by which a user can physically identify and locate the Thing by auditory, visual or other signaling."
W3C_WoT_Architecture.html,Added new section for Secure Transport. This section defines under what conditions (D)TLS should or must be used.
Thread_Spec_Features.pdf,"The RIO indicates to them that IPv6 packets destined to IPv6 addresses within the OMR Prefix should be sent to the Thread Border Router for forwarding, rather than being sent to their usual IPv6 default router (if present)."
Thread_Spec_Features.pdf,"However, a Thread Certified Component must implement the TCP initiator and listener roles and must implement a well-defined API to use these roles."
Thread_Spec_Features.pdf,Protocols that run over UDP can’t provide this capability or must provide traversal keep-alive traffic at excessively high rates to deal with short hole lifetimes.
Thread_Network_Fundamentals.pdf,"However, the SED can and will select another Parent if its current Parent is unavailable, so this failure should not be visible to the user."
Thread_Network_Fundamentals.pdf,Adding a new device to a Thread Network There are three phases a new device must go through before it can participate in a Thread Network: 1.
Thread_Network_Fundamentals.pdf,"Discovery Before a Thread Device can participate in a Thread Network, it must first discover and establish contact with a Joiner Router for commissioning."
