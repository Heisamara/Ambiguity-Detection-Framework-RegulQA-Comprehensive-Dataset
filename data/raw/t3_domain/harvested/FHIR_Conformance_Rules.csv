FHIR_Conformance_Rules.html,"This specification uses the conformance verbs SHALL, SHOULD, and MAY as defined in RFC 2119. Unlike RFC 2119, however, this specification allows that different applications might not be able to interoperate because of how they use optional features. In particular:"
FHIR_Conformance_Rules.html,SHALL: an absolute requirement for all implementations
FHIR_Conformance_Rules.html,SHALL NOT: an absolute prohibition against inclusion for all implementations
FHIR_Conformance_Rules.html,"SHOULD/SHOULD NOT: A best practice or recommendation to be considered by implementers within the context of their particular implementation; there may be valid reasons to ignore an item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course"
FHIR_Conformance_Rules.html,"The contents of a resource and the formats used to represent resources SHALL conform to the rules described in this specification, as defined in the narrative of the specification, and as controlled by the conformance properties defined below."
FHIR_Conformance_Rules.html,"Note that when present, elements cannot be empty - they SHALL have a value attribute, child elements, or extensions. The element's value attribute/property can never be empty. Either it is absent, or it is present with at least one character of non-whitespace content. This means that setting an element to a minimum cardinality of 1 does not ensure that data will be present; specific FHIRPath constraints are required to ensure that the required data will be present."
FHIR_Conformance_Rules.html,"Clients should not depend on servers maintaining ordering of elements, unless the retrieved resource conforms to a profile which mandates maintenance of ordering. If a server cannot maintain ordering, it must strip off known profile tags which require maintenance of ordering, and strip off unknown profiles (since they might require maintenance of ordering)."
FHIR_Conformance_Rules.html,"Whether an element is a modifier cannot be changed when element usage is described in a constraining Structure Definition . When an element is labeled as Is-Modifier, the documentation must be clear about why it is a modifier."
FHIR_Conformance_Rules.html,"If a narrative summary is present, and the status is generated , Is-Modifier elements SHALL be represented in the narrative summary of the resource. If Narrative is present with some other status Is-modifier elements SHOULD be represented."
FHIR_Conformance_Rules.html,"The FHIR specification is primarily concerned with valid interfaces of various kinds (APIs, messaging, etc.) and the rules for the content in resource instances exchanged between applications. Implementation guides that describe specific implementation solutions and application roles are also concerned with application behavior - what information must be provided under what conditions, and setting expectations for how particular data elements are handled."
FHIR_Conformance_Rules.html,"Many constraints are defined in the base specification. In addition, additional constraints may be defined in profiles that apply to resources. Systems are not required to evaluate the constraints, just as they are not required to check for conformance, or schema validity. However, systems SHOULD always ensure that all resources are valid against all applicable constraints."
