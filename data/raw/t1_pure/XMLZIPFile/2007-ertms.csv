The document primarily defines the operational requirements and therefore contains only a few technical terms. For consistency reasons, all functional requirements not implemented in the SRS 2.3.0 have been removed from this version. In the requirements of this document: (M) = Mandatory:The requirement shall be respected in every ETCS application. The applicable requirements stated in ETCS SRS and lower level mandatory specifications shall be respected. (O) = Optional:It is not mandatory to implement this function in every ETCS application. If implemented, the applicable requirements stated in ETCS SRS and lower level mandatory specifications shall be respected. Note that the CCS TSI may define specific conditions, where implementation of O functions may be required for safety reasons. General requirements Basic functioning ETCS shall provide the driver with information to allow him to drive the train safely. M ETCS shall be able to supervise train and shunting movements. M If the supervision is performed by a RBC it shall be possible to prevent movements of a traction unit in its area if not authorised by the RBC. M ETCS is required to be functional to a maximum train speed of 500 km/h. M Application levels The following definitions shall apply for the ETCS application levels: Level 0: ETCS active for limited train control function; trackside not fitted with any train control system or fitted with a train control system for which no STM is available onboard. Level 1: Basic track to train information via intermittent transmission media, e.g. balises. This information can be supported by infill, transmitted via balise, loop or radio. Level 2: Basic track to train and train to track information via continuous transmission media, i.e. radio. The train detection is provided by trackside. Level 3: Same as level 2 except that train integrity is provided by onboard and therefore trackside. train detection is optional. Level STM (Specific Transmission Module): Track to train information provided by national system. Onboard functions provided by national system (STM) in co-operation with onboard ETCS. M It shall be possible to implement one or more of the ETCS application levels on a line. O Trains equipped for ERTMS/ETCS application level 3 shall be able to run on lines equipped with ERTMS/ETCS application level 3, 2, 1 and 0, trains equipped for ERTMS/ETCS application level 2 shall be able to run on lines equipped with ERTMS/ETCS application level 2, 1 and 0 and trains equipped for ERTMS/ETCS application level 1 shall be able to run on lines equipped with ERTMS/ETCS application level 1 and 0.

Station Where there can be points (facing or trailing) that makes it possible for the train to use different routes. (Not identical with the BR definition). STM Specific Transmission Module Stop signal Position, from where no movement authority is given to a train, not necessarily a fixed signal. SSRS The ETCS Sub-System Requirements Specifications (e.g. ETCS cab, ETCS balise, ETCS radio) Tandem Two or more traction units, mechanically and pneumatically but not electrically coupled together, used in the same train. Each traction unit requires a separate driver. Target Location where any ETCS information changes or intermittent transmission is expected. Temporary speed restriction Speed restriction on behalf of planned, temporary conditions, e.g. track maintenance. Traction unit Vehicle with driving cab(s) from where a movement may be operated. Track circuit Trackside device used for track free/occupied determination. Track free Determination of a track section not occupied by any railway vehicle. Determination is traditionally based on track circuits or axle counters, but may on ETCS equipped lines be replaced by train location and train Integrity functions. Track occupied Track occupied by railway vehicle(s). Determination is traditionally based on track circuits or axle counters, but may on ETCS equipped lines be replaced by train location and train integrity functions. Because of the fail safe construction track occupied could mean: track not determined free. Track-to-train transmission Transmission of ETCS information from any trackside equipment to a train via balise, loop, radio or other media. Using intermittent transmission (balise or loop) the information can only be transmitted to a train passing the transmission unit. Train A traction unit with or without coupled railway vehicles or a train set of vehicles with ETCS train data available. Train data Data that characterises a train and which is required by ETCS in order to supervise a train movement Train memory Tables in the trainborne ETCS equipment for the countries to be selected according to national rules. Train movement When vehicles are moved with train data available, as a rule from station to station, and as a rule under the authority of ""proceed"" aspects from main signals, or similar procedures. Train-to-track transmission Transmission of ETCS information from a train to any trackside equipment via balise, loop, radio or other media. Using intermittent transmission (balise or short loop) the information can only be transmitted from a train passing the transmission unit. Train trip Is used when a train passes a ""danger"" signal, excluding any occasion when a suppress facility is used, and causes an immediate application of the emergency brake. Warning Audible and/or visual indication to alert the driver to a condition which requires a positive action by the driver. Wheelslip When a traction-driven wheel loses adhesion with the rails. Wheelslide When a braked wheel loses adhesion with the rails. Other technical functions"

Absolute braking distance The distance between a train following another train shall be equal to or greater than the braking distance of the following train. Acknowledge New data/situation that the driver has to accept to avoid intervention. Acknowledgement New data/situation that the driver has to accept to avoid intervention. Advisory information Information indicated to the driver on the DMI to assist him in driving the train. Axle counter A method of “train detection”. Track mounted equipment counts he number of axles entering and leaving a track section at each extremity. A calculation is performed to determine whether the track section is “occupied” or clear. Balise Device used for intermittent transmission between track and train and/or train and track. Banking An additional traction unit at the rear end of the train, not coupled, supporting the train for moving up a hill, leaving the train on top whilst running. Block A method of controlling the separation between trains by dividing the line into sections with, normally, no more than one train in each section. The block can either be a fixed block or a moving block. Braking curve A speed-distance curve calculated from train and infrastructure data and deceleration parameters of the train. Confirm The driver’s approval/validation that new data/information shall be taken into account by the system. Confirmation The driver’s approval/validation that new data/information shall be taken into account by the system. Continuous data transmission Track-to-train or train-to-track transmission can take place continuously via long loop or radio. The information is dedicated by a unique ETCS identifier. CTS Centralized Train Signalling. movement authorities and possibly static train profiles are calculated in the CTS and transmitted to the train via ETCS. Default value Value stored in the ETCS trainborne equipment and used if there is no other value being available. DMI Driver Machine Interface. The trainborne device indicating ETCS information to the driver and used by the driver for operating ETCS. Driving ""on sight"" The driver has to drive at a speed he is able to stop the train or the shunting movement respecting any obstacle on the track that may violate his vehicle(s). Dynamic train speed profile The speed-distance curve which a train may follow without violating the static train speed profile and the end of movement authority.
